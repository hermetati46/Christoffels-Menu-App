# Project Overview
Christoffel's Menu is a streamlined tool to replace complex digital menu systems. A chef can quickly update the day's offerings, ensuring the menu is always current. The application features a clean, user-friendly design focused on efficiency and ease of use. It also includes a filtered "guest view" to see the menu as a customer would.

# How It Works
The application is built around a few key screens, allowing for a logical and straightforward user experience:

- **Welcome Screen:** The app opens with a splash screen featuring the restaurant's logo, which automatically transitions to the main dashboard.

- **Home Screen (Dashboard):** This is the central hub. Here, the chef can see a complete list of all menu items. From this screen, they can:
  - Tap "Add Item" to navigate to the Add Item screen.
  - Tap the delete icon next to an item to remove it.
  - Tap "Filter" to see the customer-facing menu view.

- **Add Item Screen:** A form for adding a new dish to the menu. The chef can input the dish name, a description, the price, and select a course (e.g., Starters, Mains, Desserts). Tapping "Save" adds the item and returns to the Home Screen, while "Cancel" discards the changes.

- **Filter Screen (Today's Menu):** This screen displays the menu from a customer's perspective. The chef can filter the view by course category (All, Starters, Mains, Desserts) to see how the menu is organized. A "Back to Dashboard" button returns them to the Home Screen.

# Features
- **View All Menu Items:** A clear, scrollable list of all dishes on the Home Screen.

- **Add New Dishes:** Easily add new items with details like name, description, price, and course.

- **Delete Dishes:** Remove items from the menu with a single tap.

- **Filter Menu:** View the menu by specific courses, simulating a guest's experience.
